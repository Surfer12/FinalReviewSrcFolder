### Question 1
```java
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) { // Initialize i to the last index of the array, decrement i by 1 each time, continue until i is less than 0
System.out.print(arr[i] + " "); // Print the value of the array at index i
} // This reverses the array by starting at the last element and printing it, then moving to the next element until the first element is printed.
```

**What will be the output of this code?**
