Yes, you are correct! The difference between `x++` and `++x` lies in when the increment operation occurs relative to the assignment.

- **Postfix Increment (`x++`)**: This means that the current value of `x` is used in the expression first, and then `x` is incremented. So in your code:
  ```java
  int y = x++;
  ```
  Here, `y` is assigned the value of `x` (which is 5), and then `x` is incremented to 6. Therefore, `y` will be 5.

- **Prefix Increment (`++x`)**: This means that `x` is incremented first, and then the new value of `x` is used in the expression. If you had written:
  ```java
  int y = ++x;
  ```
  In this case, `x` would be incremented to 6 first, and then `y` would be assigned the value of `x`, which would also be 6.

So, to summarize:
- `x++` (postfix) uses the value of `x` before incrementing.
- `++x` (prefix) increments `x` first and then uses the new value.

This is a common point of confusion, but understanding the order of operations helps clarify how these increments work!
