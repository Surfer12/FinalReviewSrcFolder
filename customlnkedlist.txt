In the provided `CustomLinkedList` implementation, the `prev` field in the `Node` class is not considered "unused" in the sense that it is defined and assigned a value when a new node is added. However, it may be perceived as "unused" if it is not utilized in any other methods of the `CustomLinkedList` class, such as for traversal in reverse, deletion of nodes, or other operations that would benefit from having a reference to the previous node.

### Current Usage of `prev`:
- The `prev` field is assigned a value in the `add` method when a new node is added to the list:
  ```java
  newNode.prev = tail; // This line sets the previous node reference
  ```

### Why It Might Be Considered Unused:
1. **Lack of Reverse Traversal**: If there are no methods that traverse the list backward (e.g., a method to get the last element or to iterate in reverse), the `prev` field may seem unnecessary.
  
2. **No Deletion Method**: If there are no methods that utilize the `prev` reference to remove nodes from the list, it may appear that the `prev` field is not contributing to the functionality of the list.

3. **No Other Operations**: If the class does not implement any operations that require knowledge of the previous node (like inserting before a specific node or finding a node based on its previous node), the `prev` field may seem redundant.

### Suggested Improvements:
To fully utilize the `prev` field and enhance the functionality of your `CustomLinkedList`, consider implementing the following:

1. **Reverse Traversal Method**: Add a method to traverse the list backward using the `prev` references.
2. **Remove Method**: Implement a method to remove a specific node, which would require using both `next` and `prev` references.
3. **Insert Before Method**: Create a method to insert a new node before a given node, which would also utilize the `prev` reference.

Hereâ€™s a simplified version of the code highlighting the relevant part:

```java:JavaPracticeCode/CustomLinkedList.java
    // ... existing code ...

    private static class Node<E> {
        E data; // The data stored in the node
        Node<E> next; // The next node in the list
        Node<E> prev; // The previous node in the list - currently used in add method

        Node(E data) {
            this.data = data;
        }
    }

    // ... existing code ...

    /**
     * Removes the element at the specified index.
     * 
     * @param index the index of the element to remove
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of range
     */
    public void remove(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= size) {
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Index: " + index + ", Size: " + size);
        }
        Node<E> current = head;
        if (index == 0) {
            head = head.next; // Update head
            if (head != null) {
                head.prev = null; // Update prev of new head
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = 0; i < index; i++) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            if (current.prev != null) {
                current.prev.next = current.next; // Bypass current node
            }
            if (current.next != null) {
                current.next.prev = current.prev; // Bypass current node
            }
        }
        size--;
    }
```

### Explanation of the Update:
- The comment next to `Node<E> prev;` indicates that it is currently used in the `add` method.
- A new `remove` method is added to demonstrate how the `prev` field can be utilized to remove a node from the list, ensuring that the doubly linked list structure is maintained.
