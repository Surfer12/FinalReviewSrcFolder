These files contain course materials for CIS 232 (Fundamentals of Computer Science II), focused on Java programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming principles. The following documents are included:

* **Syllabus CIS 232.pdf**: 
- Outlines the course structure, including topics like data structures, algorithms, recursion, and their analysis using Java. It also details the grading scheme, course schedule, and expectations.
* **Introduction.pdf and Introduction 2.pdf**: 
- Provide an overview of Java basics, including syntax, data types, variables, conditionals, loops, and object-oriented concepts like classes and objects.
* **updated_Java Collections, Data Structures, and Iterators.pdf**: 
- Offers an introduction to the Java Collections Framework, explaining its benefits, key data structures (arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, hash tables), and the concept of iterators for navigating collections.
* **Stack and Queue Implementation in Java.pdf**: 
- Details the implementation of stack and queue data structures using both arrays and linked lists, along with explanations of their key operations and considerations for real-world use.
* **LinkedList_Summary.pdf**: 
- Provides a concise overview of linked lists, including the node structure, common methods (insertion, deletion, traversal, search), and example implementations.
* **Recursion in Java.pdf**: 
- Explains the concept of recursion, its key components (base case and recursive case), and demonstrates its application through examples like factorial and Fibonacci sequence calculations.
* **Inheritance in Java.pdf**: 
- Explores the concept of inheritance, its benefits, terminology (superclass, subclass, extends), and how it works in Java, including overriding methods and access modifiers.
* **Constructors and Inheritance in Java.pdf**: 
- Clarifies the relationship between constructors and inheritance, explaining how superclass constructors are called from subclass constructors and the use of the super keyword.
* **Interfaces and Abstract Classes in Java.pdf**: 
- Covers the concepts of interfaces and abstract classes, their key differences, benefits, and how they promote abstraction, polymorphism, and code reusability in Java programs.
* **Generics in Java.pdf**: 
- Introduces generics, their purpose, benefits (type safety, code reusability, readability), and how to use them in classes and methods.
* **Sorting Algorithms.pdf**: 
- Discusses various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort), their principles, steps, code implementations, flowcharts, and time complexities.
* **Important To Remember.pdf**: 
- Provides a cheat sheet for essential concepts like class diagrams, flowcharts, time complexity analysis (Big O notation), and common data structure operations, serving as a quick reference for key points.
* **Task 1.pdf**: 
- Presents a programming task to create a gradebook calculator in Java, outlining the objectives, requirements (input, calculations, output), and offering tips for implementation. It also poses a challenge to handle dynamic student numbers.
