### Course Description
The course continues the fundamentals of algorithmic problem solving and applications in the engineering of modern computer software using procedural and object-based methods and object-oriented programming languages. It presents the principles of abstract data types, including the specification and implementation of simple abstractions such as tables, stacks, queues, and lists. It includes basic searching and sorting algorithms and introduces the analysis of algorithms and recursion. The course uses Java as the programming language.

### Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to:

1. **Analyze problems, design algorithms, and implement and test the algorithm** in a modern object-oriented programming language.
2. **Apply procedural and object-oriented methods** in developing computer software.
3. **Use classic data abstractions** such as stacks and lists.
4. **Use classic algorithmic techniques** such as recursion, exception, sorting, and searching.
5. **Perform simple formal and empirical analysis of algorithms**.
6. **Define the Abstract Data Types** covered, including arrays, vectors, collections, lists, stacks, queues, and collections.
