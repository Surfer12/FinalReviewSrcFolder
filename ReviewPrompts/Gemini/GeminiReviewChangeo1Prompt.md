### Example of a Well-Crafted Code Review Prompt



**Code Snippet:**

```java

public class Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2};

        for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {

            System.out.println(numbers[i]);

        }

    }

}

```



**Context:**

This program initializes an array of integers and prints each element to the console. It is part of a basic Java course focusing on arrays and loops.



**Review Questions:**



1. **Multiple Choice:**

   - What is the time complexity of the for-loop in the `main` method?

     - A) O(1)

     - B) O(n)

     - C) O(n^2)

     - D) O(log n)

   - **Answer:** B) O(n)

   - **Explanation:** The loop iterates through each element of the array once.



2. **Short Answer:**

   - Explain how you would modify the program to sort the array before printing its elements.

   - **Sample Response:** I would implement a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or use `Arrays.sort(numbers)` before the for-loop to arrange the elements in ascending order.



3. **Code Snippet:**

   - Identify any potential improvements or best practices that can be applied to the provided code.

   - **Solution:** 

     - Use enhanced for-loop for better readability:

       ```java

       for(int number : numbers) {

           System.out.println(number);

       }

       ```

     - Add comments to explain the purpose of the code.

     - Consider handling possible exceptions if the array is dynamically generated.
