#### **7. Example of a Well-Crafted Code Review Prompt**

**Code Snippet:**
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {5, 3, 8, 4, 2};
        for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(numbers[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Context:**
This program initializes an array of integers and prints each element to the console. It is part of a basic Java course focusing on arrays and loops. The assignment aims to demonstrate understanding of array manipulation and control flow statements.

**Review Questions:**

1. **Multiple Choice:**
   - What is the time complexity of the for-loop in the `main` method?
     - A) O(1)
     - B) O(n)
     - C) O(n²)
     - D) O(log n)
   - **Answer:** B) O(n)
   - **Explanation:** The loop iterates through each element of the array once, resulting in linear time complexity.

2. **Short Answer:**
   - Explain how you would modify the program to sort the array before printing its elements.
   - **Sample Response:** I would implement a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or use `Arrays.sort(numbers)` before the for-loop to arrange the elements in ascending order.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   - Identify any potential improvements or best practices that can be applied to the provided code.
   - **Solution:** 
     - Use an enhanced for-loop for better readability:
       ```java
       for(int number : numbers) {
           System.out.println(number);
       }
       ```
     - Add comments to explain the purpose of the code.
     - Consider handling possible exceptions if the array is dynamically generated.
